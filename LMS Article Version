Course: PLP Academy — AI & Machine Learning Module

💡 The Problem

Climate change remains one of the most pressing challenges of our time.
The transport sector is a major contributor to global CO₂ emissions — over 24% of total emissions come from vehicles. Understanding and predicting these emissions is key to designing smarter policies and sustainable technologies.

🧠 The AI Solution

This project applies machine learning (supervised learning) to predict CO₂ emissions based on car specifications such as:

Engine size

Cylinders

Fuel consumption (city/highway/combined)

By analyzing these attributes, the AI model identifies patterns that influence emissions and offers actionable insights for reducing pollution.

🧰 How It Works

Using the CO2_Emissions.csv dataset, I trained two models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

After comparing their performance:

Random Forest achieved R² = 0.975, meaning it accurately predicts emission values.

Users can even input new car specs to instantly get a predicted emission score.

📊 Key Results

Larger engine size = higher CO₂ emissions

Vehicles with better fuel efficiency = lower emissions

The model helps policymakers and manufacturers identify where improvements can cut emissions fastest.

🌿 Ethical Reflection

Data bias can occur if certain car types (like hybrids or EVs) are underrepresented.
The project promotes fairness and sustainability, ensuring AI-driven insights benefit the planet and not just industry profits.

💬 Impact

This AI solution can:

Help governments predict national CO₂ trends.

Assist automakers in designing eco-friendly vehicles.

Guide consumers toward greener car choices.

🧩 Conclusion

Artificial Intelligence, when aligned with sustainability, can accelerate progress toward SDG 13 — Climate Action.
This project shows how a small model can make a big environmental difference.
